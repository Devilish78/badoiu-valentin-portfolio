# ðŸŽ¥ Video Demonstration Script

## Required Video Content

As per the project brief, create a short MP4 or animated GIF demonstrating:

### 1. Hero Animation (0-5 seconds)
**What to Show:**
- Load the website fresh (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Show the background scale animation (1.08 â†’ 1.0)
- Capture the typing text animation with character stagger
- Include the subtle parallax effect on initial scroll

**Recording Tips:**
- Start recording BEFORE page load
- Keep browser window at 1200px+ width for best effect
- Scroll down slightly to show parallax movement

### 2. Scroll Reveal Animation (5-10 seconds)
**What to Show:**
- Scroll down to the Projects section
- Show cards animating in with staggered timing (80ms delays)
- Demonstrate the translateY(16px â†’ 0) + opacity animation
- Continue to Testimonials section for additional examples

**Recording Tips:**
- Scroll at moderate speed to capture smooth animations
- Pause briefly between sections to show complete animations
- Capture multiple reveal animations in sequence

### 3. Text/Interaction Animation (10-15 seconds)
**What to Show:**
- Hover over project cards to show elevation effects
- Hover over contact links to show underline reveals
- Demonstrate smooth color transitions
- Show any micro-interactions

**Recording Tips:**
- Move cursor deliberately to show hover states clearly
- Include multiple interaction examples
- Show both desktop and mobile responsive behavior if possible

## Recommended Recording Setup

### Screen Recording Software
- **Windows**: OBS Studio, Camtasia, or Windows Game Bar
- **Mac**: QuickTime, ScreenFlow, or built-in screen recording
- **Linux**: OBS Studio, SimpleScreenRecorder, or Kazam

### Recording Settings
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or 1280x720
- **Frame Rate**: 60fps for smooth animation capture
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264) for compatibility
- **Duration**: 15-30 seconds total

### Browser Setup
- Use Chrome or Firefox for consistent rendering
- Set window size to 1200px+ width
- Clear cache before recording (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Disable browser extensions that might affect performance

## Recording Checklist

### Before Recording
- [ ] Clear browser cache and cookies
- [ ] Close unnecessary applications
- [ ] Set browser window to optimal size
- [ ] Test animations work smoothly
- [ ] Plan the recording sequence

### During Recording
- [ ] Start recording BEFORE loading the page
- [ ] Perform a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to trigger hero animations
- [ ] Scroll at moderate, consistent speed
- [ ] Pause to let animations complete
- [ ] Demonstrate hover interactions
- [ ] Keep mouse movements smooth and deliberate

### After Recording
- [ ] Trim video to remove excess footage
- [ ] Check animation timing is clearly visible
- [ ] Ensure video quality is crisp
- [ ] Export in MP4 format
- [ ] Test playback on different devices

## Alternative: Animated GIF

If creating an MP4 is challenging, you can create an animated GIF:

### Tools for GIF Creation
- **Online**: ezgif.com, giphy.com/create
- **Software**: LICEcap, ScreenToGif, GIMP
- **From Video**: Convert MP4 to GIF using FFmpeg or online tools

### GIF Settings
- **Duration**: 10-15 seconds
- **Frame Rate**: 15-20fps (sufficient for web)
- **Optimization**: Reduce colors for smaller file size
- **Max Size**: Keep under 5MB for easy sharing

## Expected Results

Your video should clearly demonstrate:

âœ… **Hero Animation**: Background scaling and text typing  
âœ… **Scroll Reveals**: Staggered card animations with proper easing  
âœ… **Interactions**: Hover effects and transitions  
âœ… **Performance**: Smooth 60fps animations  
âœ… **Responsiveness**: Clean layout and interactions  

## Troubleshooting

### If Animations Don't Appear
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure JavaScript is enabled
3. Try incognito/private browsing mode
4. Clear browser cache completely
5. Test in a different browser

### If Performance is Poor
1. Close other browser tabs and applications
2. Check if hardware acceleration is enabled
3. Test on a different device if available
4. Reduce browser window size if needed
